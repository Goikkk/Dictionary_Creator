function of time and column height however we found that it is still possible to extract valuable information from the capillary rise measurements because the relevant wetting data are the initial wetting rates it is highly unlikely that the initial wetting rates are affected by any dimensional changes of the fibers or even whereas as can be seen from figure the wetting process was completed after only s and then the curve levels off furthermore our measurements were always performed on fresh samples under controlled temperature conditions thus eliminating the effect caused by swelling due to previous contact with polar liquids corresponding to the normalized wetting rate was obtained by multiplying the fiber wetting rate with the factor containing the liquid properties the data points shown are averaged values of at least five repeated measurements the maximum in figure equals the critical solid vapor surface tension cc which in analogy to a zisman plot corresponds to fibers can be estimated form a gaussian fit to the normalized wetting rate which equals cl cosh as function of the liquid surface tension cl the points to the left hand side of the maximum correspond to liquids which wet the fiber surfaces completely the points to the right hand side of the maximum indicate liquids that only partially wet the fibers table the regenerated cellulose fibers to be mn the literature reports values for pure cellulose between mn and mn it seems that the actual surface tension value depends on the purity and degree of crystallinity of the cellulose for the flax fibers we et al and between mn and mn for untreated flax fibers the rest of the fibers sisal henequen and lechuguilla have very similar surface tension values which is not surprising since they have very similar chemical compositions comparing the surface tensions of abaca bold of the fibers abaca bold fibers have a lower cellulose and hemicelluloses content as compared to abaca fine the availability of the polar

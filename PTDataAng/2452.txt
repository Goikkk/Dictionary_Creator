has the greatest percentage lechuguilla and henequen fibers have a very similar chemical composition because they are all extracted using the same process from different varieties of the agave plant family grown in the same geographical region wetting properties and fiber surface tension figure shows exemplarily a set of weight gain the cell walls of the fibers will swell to a maximum due to contact with polar liquids after a finite time which reduces the average capillary radii and will thus have an effect on the rate of capillary rise in the packed fiber bed however non polar liquids are not expected to cause swelling of the cell walls furthermore the absorption of liquid into the pores and the interaction function of time and column height however we found that it is still possible to extract valuable information from the capillary rise measurements because the relevant wetting data are the initial wetting rates it is highly unlikely that the initial wetting rates are affected by any dimensional changes of the fibers or even whereas as can be seen from figure the wetting process was completed after only s and then the curve levels off furthermore our measurements were always performed on fresh samples under controlled temperature conditions thus eliminating the effect caused by swelling due to previous contact with polar liquids corresponding to the normalized wetting rate was obtained by multiplying the fiber wetting rate with the factor containing the liquid properties the data points shown are averaged values of at least five repeated measurements the maximum in figure equals the critical solid vapor surface tension cc which in analogy to a zisman plot corresponds to fibers can be estimated form a gaussian fit to the normalized wetting rate which equals cl cosh as function of the liquid surface tension cl the points to the left hand side of the maximum correspond to liquids which wet the fiber surfaces completely the points to the right hand side of the maximum indicate liquids that only partially wet the fibers table the regenerated cellulose fibers to be mn the literature reports values for pure cellulose between mn and mn it seems that the actual surface tension value depends on the purity and degree of

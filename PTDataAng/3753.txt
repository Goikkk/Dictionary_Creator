left hand side of the maximum correspond to liquids which wet the fiber surfaces completely the points to the right hand side of the maximum indicate liquids that only partially wet the fibers table the regenerated cellulose fibers to be mn the literature reports values for pure cellulose between mn and mn it seems that the actual surface tension value depends on the purity and degree of crystallinity of the cellulose for the flax fibers we et al and between mn and mn for untreated flax fibers the rest of the fibers sisal henequen and lechuguilla have very similar surface tension values which is not surprising since they have very similar chemical compositions comparing the surface tensions of abaca bold of the fibers abaca bold fibers have a lower cellulose and hemicelluloses content as compared to abaca fine the availability of the polar groups contributing to the hydrophilic character of the fibers is usually a direct result of the efficiency of the retting process as suggested in the literature for abaca bold to mn for abaca fine a similar trend was reported by van hazendonk et al who showed that the analyzing the data presented in tables and we find that the surface tension increases almost linearly with increasing cellulose content of the lignocellulosic fibers extrapolating the linear fit to content it yields a hypothetical surface tension of mn for pure cellulose which is in excellent agreement with of the fibers figure shows the measured for the leaf fibers sisal henequen and lechuguilla figure the for the bast fibers abaca fine abaca bold flax and hemp and figure the for the fruit fibers cornhusk and luffa as can be

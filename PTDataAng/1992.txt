the different fiber components quantified does not add up to simply because only the major components are reported we did not determine the amount of pectin pentosan and proteins as well as the extractable organic matter such as waxes fatty alcohols fatty acids and different esters similarly the cellulose content of henequen fibers is approx wt which is in good agreement to the value reported by valadez gonzalez et al flax and hemp fibers have the highest cellulose content of around wt abaca fine has the highest lignin content of around wt cornhusk has the greatest percentage lechuguilla and henequen fibers have a very similar chemical composition because they are all extracted using the same process from different varieties of the agave plant family grown in the same geographical region wetting properties and fiber surface tension figure shows exemplarily a set of weight gain the cell walls of the fibers will swell to a maximum due to contact with polar liquids after a finite time which reduces the average capillary radii and will thus have an effect on the rate of capillary rise in the packed fiber bed however non polar liquids are not expected to cause swelling of the cell walls furthermore the absorption of liquid into the pores and the interaction function of time and column height however we found that it is still possible to extract valuable information from the capillary rise measurements because the relevant wetting data are the initial wetting rates it is highly unlikely that the initial wetting rates are affected by any dimensional changes of the fibers or even whereas as can be seen from figure the wetting process was completed after only s and then the curve levels off furthermore our measurements were always performed on fresh samples under controlled temperature conditions thus eliminating the effect caused by swelling due to previous contact with

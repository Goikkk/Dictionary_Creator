wet the fibers table the regenerated cellulose fibers to be mn the literature reports values for pure cellulose between mn and mn it seems that the actual surface tension value depends on the purity and degree of crystallinity of the cellulose for the flax fibers we et al and between mn and mn for untreated flax fibers the rest of the fibers sisal henequen and lechuguilla have very similar surface tension values which is not surprising since they have very similar chemical compositions comparing the surface tensions of abaca bold of the fibers abaca bold fibers have a lower cellulose and hemicelluloses content as compared to abaca fine the availability of the polar groups contributing to the hydrophilic character of the fibers is usually a direct result of the efficiency of the retting process as suggested in the literature for abaca bold to mn for abaca fine a similar trend was reported by van hazendonk et al who showed that the analyzing the data presented in tables and we find that the surface tension increases almost linearly with increasing cellulose content of the lignocellulosic fibers extrapolating the linear fit to content it yields a hypothetical surface tension of mn for pure cellulose which is in excellent agreement with of the fibers figure shows the measured for the leaf fibers sisal henequen and lechuguilla figure the for the bast fibers abaca fine abaca bold flax and hemp and figure the for the fruit fibers cornhusk and luffa as can be seen from figures the value of the potential decreases rapidly to approach a much smaller value flax and cornhusk the potential of the fibers increases from a value on different time scales asymptotically to a constant but larger value for flax fibers and cornhusk the potential was initially positive and decreases with time to a much smaller potential moreover as the measurements advanced and the plateau developed by for jute fibers and green hemp the positive f potentials measured for flax and cornhusk is most likely due to the presence of proteins and amino acids in the surfaces of these fibers cornhusk contains up to the relative ratio of the acid base groups present in these compounds but also on the superstructure of the fiber which determines which of the functional groups is actually exposed at the fiber electrolyte interface will determine the surface charge of the fibers in aqueous solutions some amino acids and proteins with relatively serine proline tyrosine asparagine glutamine tryptophan histidine and arginine the potential
